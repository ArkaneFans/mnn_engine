# Third-party notices

The Android native libraries distributed with `mnn_engine` are built from the
projects and toolchains listed below. The public build manifest in
[`native/android-arm64-v8a.json`](native/android-arm64-v8a.json) records the
exact MNN commit, toolchain versions, build flags, Build IDs, sizes, and
SHA-256 digests for the bundled artifacts.

## Alibaba MNN

- Project: [Alibaba MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN)
- Version: 3.6.1
- Commit: `d407447ed56c4121a11ccbd266dc184ca1ead0c2`
- Copyright: Copyright 2018 Alibaba Group
- License: Apache License 2.0

`mnn_engine` is an independent community plugin and is not an official Alibaba
Flutter package.

## Optional Hexagon runtime

The common package compiles MNN's Hexagon host backend but does not include
the Qualcomm SDK or SDK-built DSP libraries. Optional Hexagon packages add
one SDK-built ARM64 stub and v73/v75/v79/v81 DSP skeletons with their matching
DSP C++ runtimes; their provenance and
hashes are recorded in the native and asset manifests. Distributors of those
optional artifacts must follow the Qualcomm SDK runtime redistribution terms.
The device's OEM FastRPC driver is not redistributed by this package.

The default optional build uses the Snapdragon toolchain v0.7 container
(`ghcr.io/snapdragon-toolchain/arm64-android`), pinned to digest
`sha256:91714433626f0d94a926538a1e46ec43756c5b8e3262b91b95df1e812940aed1`.
It includes Hexagon SDK 6.6.0.0 and Hexagon Clang 19.0.07. Native bundles contain
the runtime artifacts listed above, without the SDK installation, compiler
binaries or container image.
The asset manifest records the actual SDK, compiler, Android NDK, image ID,
adapter hashes and expected firmware dependencies for each architecture.
Only the matching DSP runtime is extracted and loaded on a device.
